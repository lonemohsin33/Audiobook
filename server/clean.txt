LEAVING HOME
ie Zhu sat on the side of a little road in the village, looking at the blue
sky in a daze. Tie Zhu was not his real name, but a nickname. Due to
his poor health as a child his father was afraid he might not live so he was
given this nickname as a tradition.
His real name was Wang Lin. The Wang family was considered a big
family name in the area, a family of carpenters. The Wang family was well
known in  the  area, and  they  owned a  number of  shops that  sold  wood
products.
Tie Zhu’s father was the second son of the family. He was born from a
concubine; therefore, he couldn’t take over the family business, so he left
the house after he got married and settled in this village.
However, due to his father being a skilled carpenter, Tie Zhu’s family
was pretty well off, not having to worry about food or clothes. They were
well respected within the village.
Tie Zhu had been very intelligent ever since he was little. He loved to
read  books and  thought deeply  about matters. Almost everyone in  the
praise Tie Zhu, the wrinkles on his face would fade and he would reveal a
village agreed that he was a prodigy. Every time his father heard someone
happy smile.

His mother cared for him a lot. One could say that he had grown up in
his parents’ love. He knew that his parents had high expectations of him.
Other children his age were all working in the fields, while he sat at home
reading.
The more he read, the more he thought about. He yearned for the world
road. After letting out a sigh, he closed his book, got up, and walked home.
outside of the village. Tie Zhu raised his head and looked at the end of the
His father was sitting in the courtyard. Holding a pipe, he took a deep
breath and asked, “Tie Zhu, how goes your studies?” as Tie Zhu walked
through the door.
Tie Zhu muttered a few words as he passed by. His father shook the
ashes out  of  his  pipe, rose  up,  and  said, “Tie  Zhu, you  have  to  study
properly. Next year is the district exam. Whether you have a future or not
will all depend on this exam. Don’t end up like me, who will spend my
entire life in a village.”
“Enough, you complain about this every day. If you ask me, our Tie Zhu
will definitely pass the exam!” Tie Zhu’s mother carried over some food
and set it on the table. She gestured at the two to come and eat.
Tie Zhu responded with a sound, then he sat down and casually ate a
few mouthfuls. His mother affectionately looked at him and passed him the
few pieces of meat there were.
“Dad, is  Fourth  Uncle almost here?” Tie  Zhu  asked as  he  raised  his
head.
“Calculating the  time, it  should be  within these next  few  days. Your
fourth uncle is more successful than your father. Hey, Tie Zhu’s mom, have
the special dishes prepared for Fourth Uncle all been packed?” The moment
Tie Zhu’s father mentioned Fourth Uncle, there was a hint of sadness on his
face.

achieve success, don’t forget to repay your fourth uncle.”
As Tie Zhu’s mom was talking, the sound of a horse was heard outside
the door. Following the sound of the horse drawn carriage, a hearty laugh
could be heard.
“Second Brother, open the door!”
He saw a strong middle-aged man with bright eyes standing outside. When

The middle-aged man winked in his direction and jokingly said, “Tie
Zhu, since when were you so diligent? I remember the last time I was here,
you were not like this.”
Tie Zhu’s father glanced at Tie Zhu and said, “This little rascal was just
inquiring about when you would arrive.”
The middle-aged man saw Tie Zhu blushing and laughingly said, “Tie
Zhu, your  fourth uncle hasn’t  forgotten his  promise to  you.” After he
finished speaking, he took out two books and placed them on the table.
Tie Zhu excitedly cheered, then flipped through the books. He could

The middle-aged man shook his head and said, “Second Sister-in-Law,
home early tomorrow morning. After this busy time, I’ll come back and see
you guys.” He gave his second brother a regretful look.
Tie Zhu’s father sighed, saying, “Don’t listen to my wife. Properly pack
the goods tomorrow. The family’s matters are more important. We can meet
next time.”
The middle-aged man looked at Tie Zhu’s father and asked, “Second
Brother, Tie Zhu is 15 years old, yes?”
Tie Zhu’s father nodded and said, “After this year, this little rascal is
going to be 16. In a flash, more than 10 years have quickly passed by.” He
look at his son dotingly.
The middle-aged man pondered for a while and said, in a serious tone,
“Second Brother, Second Sister-in-Law, I have something to tell you: the
Heng Yue  Sect is  taking in  disciples. This year,  the  family has  three

recommendation slots, and I received one of them.”
The middle-aged man smiled, nodded, and said, “Second Brother, it is
that very immortal sect! Our family is still a prominent one in the area and
has the qualifications to recommend potential disciples. You know my boy,
he can’t really study, but he is good with swords and knives. I doubt the
immortal sect will take my son. This spot is really precious. I know Tie Zhu
has been very smart since he was little and has always loved to study. He
might have a chance.”
Tie Zhu’s mother felt delighted and said, “Fourth Brother, this ... this
...”
The middle-aged man rubbed Tie Zhu’s head and said, “Second Brother,
Second Sister-in-Law, let this matter be settled. Let Tie Zhu try; if he really
gets accepted, it is his fortune.”

Tie  Zhu  confusedly looked at  his  parents and  his  fourth uncle.  He
wasn’t  able  to  understand what was  going on.  “Immortals? What are
immortals?” Tie Zhu softly and hesitantly asked.
The  middle-aged  man’s  face  turned serious. Looking at  Tie  Zhu, he
said, “Tie Zhu, immortals are those who can fly in the sky. They are simply
not something we mortals can understand.”
Tie Zhu was confused but grew curious of immortals.
Tie Zhu’s father excitedly got up, pulled Tie Zhu’s mom, and was about
to bow to the middle-aged man. The middle-aged man quickly pulled them
up and sincerely said, “Second Brother, what are you doing? My mother
died early. If it wasn’t for Second Brother’s mother taking care of me, I
wouldn’t be here today. Tie Zhu is my nephew and this is the least I can
do.”
Tie  Zhu’s  father started crying.  He  heavily patted the  middle-aged
